# Global settings applied to the whole site.

# “base” is the directory to change to before starting build. If you set base:
#        that is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc, not repo root!
# “command” is your build command.
# “publish” is the directory to publish (relative to the root of your repo).

[build]
  #base    = "site"
  command = "hugo"
  publish = "public"

# Production context: All deploys to the main
# repository branch will inherit these settings.
